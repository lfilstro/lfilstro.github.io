## About me

Since June 2020, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher within the [PML](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) group of Aalto University, working under the supervision of Prof. [Samuel Kaski](https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski).

Before that, I was a Ph.D. student within the [SC](http://sc.enseeiht.fr/) group of [IRIT](http://www.irit.fr) (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse). I was working under the supervision of [Cédric Févotte](http://www.irit.fr/~Cedric.Fevotte), and was a member of the [FACTORY](http://projectfactory.irit.fr/index.html) ERC project. My defense took place on Nov. 13, 2019.

## Short bio

I graduated (M.Sc) from École Centrale de Lille and from Université Lille 1 in Sept. 2015. I then worked as a research engineer within the [SIGMA](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?rubrique27&eid=30) group of [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr), with [Patrick Bas](http://patrickbas.ec-lille.fr/Patrick_Bas_home_page/Home_Page.html). Finally, I was a Ph.D. student between Sept. 2016 and Nov. 2019.

## Research interests

I am broadly interested in statistical machine learning. Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of more specific topics I have worked on:
* Latent variable models, model-based approaches;
* (Probabilistic) matrix factorization;
* Bayesian modeling, computational statistics;
* Active learning, Bayesian experimental design.

## Community involvement

I have served as a reviewer for various international machine learning conferences, including ICASSP, MLSP, AISTATS and IJCAI. I have also served as a reviewer for IEEE TSP and Pattern Recognition Letters.
