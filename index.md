## About me

I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student, within the the [SC](http://sc.enseeiht.fr/) group of [IRIT](http://www.irit.fr) (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse). I am working under the supervision of [Cédric Févotte](http://www.irit.fr/~Cedric.Fevotte). As such, I am a member of the [FACTORY](http://projectfactory.irit.fr/index.html) project. My research focuses on maximum marginal likelihood estimation for non-negative matrix factorization.

## Short bio

I graduated from École Centrale de Lille and from Université Lille 1 in Sept. 2015. I then worked as research engineer within the [SIGMA](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?rubrique27&eid=30) group of [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr), with [Patrick Bas](http://patrickbas.ec-lille.fr/Patrick_Bas_home_page/Home_Page.html). I have been working as a Ph.D. student since Sept. 2016.
