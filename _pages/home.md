## About me

I currently hold a temporary faculty position (in French, *ATER*) at [ENSAI](https://ensai.fr/), and am a member of the CREST laboratory (*Centre de recherche en économie et statistique*). I joined in September 2022.

## Short bio

Before joining ENSAI, I worked for more than 2 years as a postdoctoral researcher within the [PML](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) group of Aalto University under the supervision of Prof. [Samuel Kaski](https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski).

And before joining Aalto university, I was a Ph.D. student within the [SC](https://www.irit.fr/departement/signaux-images/sc/) group of [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) (*Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse*). I was working under the supervision of [Cédric Févotte](https://www.irit.fr/~Cedric.Fevotte), and my defense took place on Nov. 13, 2019.

And even before that, I worked as a research engineer within the [SIGMA](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?rubrique27&eid=30) group of [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr) (*Centre de Recherche en Informatique, Signal et Automatique de Lille*), with [Patrick Bas](http://patrickbas.ec-lille.fr/Patrick_Bas_home_page/Home_Page.html).

## Research interests

I am broadly interested in probabilistic machine learning and statistical learning. Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of more specific topics I have worked on:
* Latent variable models, model-based approaches;
* (Probabilistic) matrix factorization;
* Bayesian modeling, computational statistics;
* Active learning, Bayesian experimental design, Bayesian optimization;
* Human-in-the-loop machine learning.

## Community involvement

I have served as a reviewer for various international machine learning conferences, including AISTATS, ICML, and IJCAI. I have also served as a reviewer for the journals IEEE TSP, IEEE PAMI, and JMLR.
